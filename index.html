            <p>Hi! If you are looking at this, you are interested in my work and what I can do to help you. I will start
                by stating I am a first child, so identifying and solving problems is part of who I am. I have helped
                brands like North Woods Lodge Alaska with digital media solutions, Asali Gold with marketing and social
                media strategies, and Studio 22 with artistic advertising solutions. I don't just solve your problem â€” I
                find the heart of the problem and stop it there!</p>

            <p>Below are some of the projects I have had the opportunity to work on and am proud to display!</p>

            <!-- Pawfect Pet Care Project -->
            <img src="pawfectpetcare/petpic.jpg" alt="Mini Australian Shepherd looking off into the distance">
            <p>This project was based around using Bootstrap and building an efficient website that didn't require an external stylesheet.</p>

            <!-- Fit for Fitness Project -->
            <img src="WebDesignFFF/bootinwater.jpg" alt="Boot creating mud in water">
            <p>This project allowed me the opportunity to work with Flexbox and a mobile-first web design platform, which is fantastic considering the nature of modern-day technology.</p>
