            <p>Hi! If you are looking at this, you are interested in my work and what I can do to help you. I will start
                by stating I am a first child, so identifying and solving problems is part of who I am. I have helped
                brands like North Woods Lodge Alaska with digital media solutions, Asali Gold with marketing and social
                media strategies, and Studio 22 with artistic advertising solutions. I don't just solve your problem â€” I
                find the heart of the problem and stop it there!</p>
